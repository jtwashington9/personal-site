            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>When it comes to interests or hobbies, I'm a pretty eclectic person. Because of this, I wouldn't quite consider myself particularly skilled at any one thing. My habit of hopping from 
             one activity to another better lends itselfto the category of "jack of all trades, master of none".I guess it's not reall a bad thing, but I would like to start devoting more time to just 
             focus on one thing at a time so that I could actually give myself the time to improve. Things that I'm interested in include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reading</li>
                <li>Drawing</li>
                <li>Playing instruments (flute, piano, etc.)</li>
                <li>Cooking/baking</li>
                <li>Playing Video Games</li>
                <li>Learning new things/skills</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since the page is still looking pretty empty, I guess I'll just give some info the things  veer to most.</p>
            
            <h3>Reading</h3>
            <p>Arguably, one of the things that I spend the most time on is reading. I'll read anything that catches my interest, but most of the books I have 
            are young adult or adult fiction. Currently, I own somewhere around 100 books, although I haven't bothered to count recently.</p>

            <h3>Drawing</h3>
            <p>Like most kids, I've drawn for as long as I can remember, but I've only recently started to take it seriously since 7th grade. 
            It's one of my favorite hobbbies, and also one of the two fields I'm considering looking for work in as I get older (the other field being 
            game development/computer science). </p>
