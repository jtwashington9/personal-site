           <p>Hello! My name is Jordyn, and I'm fifteen years old (turning 16 in about 3 months). In my free time, I enjoy reading, drawing, and wasting time online. I don't usually talk about myself, so I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say here, but bear with me.</p>
           <h3>General</h3>
           <p>Now that that's out of the way, let's get into some general information. I was born on the 4th of September, 2002. I wasn't born in Chicago, but also not that far from it either. I've lived here pretty much my whole life and don't have any plans for moving any time soon.
               <br>
               Going off of Myers-Briggs indicator, I test as an INTP. Kind of a random 
               fact to include, but it's interesting to me to look into sometimes. Of 
               course I know that it won't be a 100% accurate representation of me, 
               but it's cool to see the parts where it does get it right and get other 
               people's perspectives who have similar outlooks to me. If you're at all 
               intereted at testing yourself, you can do that <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">here</a>.

               <h3>Acedemics/Clubs</h3>
               
               <img src="images/king.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></img>
               <p>Currently, I go to King College Prep on the south side of Chicago. While it is a selective enrollment school, it was not
               my first choice (to be honest, it was my last). However, it actually ended up working out fairly well-- for a period of time,
               I wasn't doing well in school, but with the way King's scheduel works, it was easier for me to stay on top of my workload and
               do well.
               <br>
               <br>
               Apart from the academics portion, I also joined a few clubs and had a lot of fun. Towards the end, it ended up being a bit more than I
               could handle, but it's a nonissue at this point. Throughout the course of the year, I was in debate, band, softball, and a language
               immersion program that I'd go to after school for French. While they were all activities I found some amount of enjoyment in on their 
               own, it got pretty overwhelming at points to do all of that and also keep up with my school work. Having so many extra curriculars 
               meant scheduels and events that would often overlap with one another, making me choose between them. Next year, I definitely know that 
               I have to cut back on the amount of clubs I join.</p>
